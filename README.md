# color-flipper
My first in-house project where I implemented a color helper

This project is invented to allow the user to pick the color they want. Sometimes you don't know what combination of colors you want to see, this project will help with that. 

My goal was to practice. This project I took from my head, I invented problems and tried to solve them myself

The project is written in HTML, CSS, JS, with the addition of bootstrap.
